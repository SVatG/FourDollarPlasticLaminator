This is the source code for You Massive Clod by Fearmoths

It is fairly hard to read and some parts are obfuscated due to being optimized
for the compressor. To build this you'll need the the latest version of NASM 
and the "advancecomp" package, which contains advdef which is used to obtain
slightly higher compression rates.

I will probably write an article about the ELF crafting and OS tom-foolery at
some point in the future but if you'd rather work the source code out for 
yourself then you'd be best off looking at these documents first:

If you use this source code for a production I'd like some credit and I'd 
rather you actually did something innovative with it rather than just replacing
the shader source code, although you can feel free to do that if you please.
